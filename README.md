### Data Flow
1. User selects apps and sets time limits
2. BlockerService monitors foreground app usage
3. When limits are reached, blocking mechanisms activate
4. Users can solve math challenges for temporary access
5. Usage data is tracked and displayed in real-time

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 24+ (API level 24)
- Kotlin 1.8+
- Gradle 7.0+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd brain-rot-app
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
   - Navigate to the project directory and select it

3. **Build and Run**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click "Run" in Android Studio
   - The app will install and launch automatically

### Required Permissions

The app requires several permissions to function properly:

- **Usage Access**: Required to monitor app usage
- **Overlay Permission**: Needed to show blocking screens over other apps
- **Notification Permission**: For blocking alerts and service notifications
- **Foreground Service**: For continuous background monitoring

These permissions are requested during the onboarding flow.

## üì± Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

2. **Grant Permissions**: Follow the prompts to grant necessary permissions
3. **Select Apps**: Choose which apps you want to monitor and block
4. **Set Time Limits**: Configure daily time limits for each selected app
5. **Start Monitoring**: The app will begin monitoring your usage

### Daily Usage

- **Dashboard**: View your daily screen time and app usage statistics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The app runs in the background monitoring usage
- **Blocking**: When you reach time limits, the app will block access
- **Math Challenges**: Solve math problems to gain temporary access
- **Statistics**: Pull down to refresh usage data

### Managing Apps

1. **Add/Remove Apps**: Use the "Select Apps to Block" button
2. **Adjust Time Limits**: Use "Set Time Limits" to modify daily limits
3. **View Usage**: See how much time you've spent on each app
4. **Reset Data**: Pull to refresh to update statistics

## üîß Technical Details

### Build Configuration

```kotlin
android {
    namespace = "com.example.testing"
    compileSdk = 36
    minSdk = 24
    targetSdk = 36
    versionCode = 1
    versionName = "1.0"
}
```

### Dependencies
